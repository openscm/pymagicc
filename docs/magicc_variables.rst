MAGICC variables
================

A list of the 82 most important variables in MAGICC, a plain-english summary of what they are and a sense of their possible ranges is given in Table S1 of the Supplementary Information of `Meinshausen et al. Nature 2009 <https://media.nature.com/original/nature-assets/nature/journal/v458/n7242/extref/nature08017-s1.pdf>`_.
A sense of the constrained distribution for seven of these variables can be found in Figure S3 of the same paper.
