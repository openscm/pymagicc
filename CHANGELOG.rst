- (`#108 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/108>`_) Added ability to read all files in MAGICC6 run folder (``pymagicc/MAGICC6/run``) to a common format

    - Note that this change means that only files which follow the MAGICC6 or MAGICC7 naming convention are supported. These are very similar to MAGICC5 except that emissions files must be named in the form ``*.SCEN``, ``*.SCEN7`` or ``*EMISX.IN`` where ``X`` is ``I`` if the file contains fossil and industrial emissions and ``B`` if the file contains agriculture, land-use and land-use change emissions. The suffixes ``FOSSIL&IND`` and ``LANDUSE`` are no longer supported.
    - The renamed files are

        - ``pymagicc/MAGICC6/run/EDGAR_NOX_EMIS_LANDUSE.IN`` => ``pymagicc/MAGICC6/run/EDGAR_NOXB_EMIS.IN``
        - ``pymagicc/MAGICC6/run/EDGAR_NOX_EMIS_FOSSIL&IND.IN`` => ``pymagicc/MAGICC6/run/EDGAR_NOXI_EMIS.IN``
        - ``pymagicc/MAGICC6/run/HOUGHTON_CO2_EMIS_LANDUSE.IN`` => ``pymagicc/MAGICC6/run/HOUGHTON_CO2B_EMIS.IN``
        - ``pymagicc/MAGICC6/run/MARLAND_CO2_EMIS_FOSSIL&IND.IN`` => ``pymagicc/MAGICC6/run/MARLAND_CO2I_EMIS.IN``

    - Deleted ``pymagicc/MAGICC6/run/HIST_SEALEVEL_CHURCHWHITE2006_RF.IN`` as it's empty
    - Added ``scripts/check_run_dir_file_read.py`` so we can quickly check which files in a MAGICC ``run`` directory can be read by ``pymagicc``
    - Added new section to docs, ``docs/file_conventions.rst`` which will document all of the relevant information related to MAGICC's file conventions

Changed
~~~~~~~

- (`#323 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/323>`_) Writers raise an :obj:`AssertionError` if the user tries to write a MAGICC input file which has timesteps where some values are nan whilst others are not. Such input files would have nans in them hence would cause MAGICC's run to fail.

- (`#311 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/311>`_) Fix naming of ocean heat content and ocean heat uptake output variables to match RCMIP conventions
- (`#307 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/307>`_) Use ``scmdata.ScmRun`` as a base class for ``MAGICCData`` instead of the deprecated ``scmdata.ScmDataFrame`` (closes `#295 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/issues/295>`_)

- (`#210 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/210>`_) Updated to match new openscm naming
- (`#199 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/199>`_) Switched to OpenSCMDataFrameBase for the backend, also includes:

  - dropping Python3.5 support as OpenSCM typing is not Python3.5 compatible
  - ensuring that metadata is properly stripped when reading
  - altering ``MAGICCData.append`` so that ``MAGICCData`` instances can be appended to ``MAGICCData`` instances
  - allowing the user to specify, ``model``, ``scenario`` and ``climate_model`` when initialising a ``MAGICCData`` instance
  - automatically filling ``model``, ``scenario`` and ``climate_model`` when running

- (`#204 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/204>`_) Addressed potential bug identified in (`#203 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/issues/203>`_) and updated robustness of output file read in
- (`#198 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/198>`_) Move all install requirements into ``setup.py``
- (`#190 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/190>`_) Speed up diagnosis of TCR and ECS by removing writing of scenario file
- (`#191 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/191>`_) Fixed bugs which meant config passed to MAGICC wasn't handled correctly
- (`#191 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/191>`_) Renamed ``tests/test_api.py`` to ``tests/test_core.py``
- (`#173 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/173>`_) Renamed ``pymagicc.api`` to ``pymagicc.core``
- (`#165 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/165>`_) Moved to one unified backend for all run functionality. This one got a bit out of hand so also includes:

  - Breaking the API, hence requiring significantly re-writing the tests to match the new API, bumping the major version number and updating the examples.
  - Locking up Pymagicc so that it will only run if MAGICC's ``.CFG`` files are configured in the simplest way possible (see :ref:`MAGICC flags`). This required re-writing the ``pymagicc/MAGICC6/run/MAGCFG_USER.CFG`` file that ships with Pymagicc (although the result is the same, as confirmed by the fact that the outputs of the four RCPs are unchanged in ``tests/test_pymagicc.py``).
  - Adding a function to pull a single configuration file from a MAGICC ``PARAMETERS.OUT`` file to aid the transition to the change referred to above (i.e. one could run MAGICC with whatever config elsewhere and then get a single config file which can be used with Pymagicc from the resulting ``PARAMETERS.OUT`` file).
  - Tidying up the docs to make linking a bit simpler and more reusable.
  - Only passing ``filepath`` (i.e. the combination of path and name) to reading/writing functions to remove ambiguity in previous language which used ``file``, ``filepath``, ``path``, ``name`` and ``filename``, sometimes in a self-contradictory way.

- (`#167 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/167>`_) Updated release instructions
- (`#164 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/164>`_) Improved missing MAGICC binary message in tests as discussed in `#124 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/issues/124>`_
- (`#154 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/154>`_) Change to using OpenSCM variables for all user facing data as well as preparing to move to using OpenSCM dataframes

  - Note that this change breaks direct access but that we will gain a lot of features once we start using the capabilities of pyam as part of an OpenSCM dataframe

- (`#160 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/159>`_) Made notebooks CI more opinionated (`#158 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/issues/158>`_)
- (`#135 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/135>`_) Moved emissions definitions to a single csv and packaged all of the definitions files using the `data package standard <https://frictionlessdata.io/docs/creating-tabular-data-packages-in-python/>`_
- (`#146 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/146>`_) Removed path alteration from docs buiding
- (`#143 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/143>`_) Only read ``PARAMETERS.OUT`` file if it exists. ``MAGICCBase.config`` now defaults to ``None`` until a valid ``PARAMETERS.OUT`` file is read.
- (`#133 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/133>`_) Put definitions of MAGICC6's expected emissions into a standalone module

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~

Removed
~~~~~~~

- (`#244 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/244>`_) Use openscm from pip, hence drop Python3.6 support, and drop pyam dependency (moved into notebooks dependencies)
- (`#184 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/184>`_) Remove redundant mapping of region names for SCEN to SCEN7 conversions

Fixed
~~~~~

- (`#323 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/323>`_) Writers now automatically drop all nan timesteps before writing MAGICC input files
- (`#323 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/323>`_) ``pymagicc.scenarios.rcps`` now contains all the rcps rather than just rcp26
- (`#310 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/310>`_) Rename ``pymagicc.io.prn`` to ``pymagicc.io.prn_files`` as PRN is a reserved filename on Windows
- (`#300 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/300>`_) Fix name in docs (closes `#205 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/issues/205>`_)
- (`#298 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/298>`_) Make SCEN7 writing work with single variables
- (`#297 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/297>`_) Make Binary reader able to handle global-only binary output
- (`#281 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/281>`_) Hotfix readers and writers for ``.DAT`` files (``thisfile_datacolumns`` was wrong)
- (`#269 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/269>`_) Break circular dependency on OpenSCM by switching to using scmdata
- (`#267 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/267>`_) Hotfix appveyor failures

- (`#225 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/225>`_) Fix reading of ``DAT_CO2PF_EMIS.OUT``
- (`#223 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/223>`_) Ensure `pymagicc.io._BinaryOutReader` closes the input file
- (`#222 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/222>`_) Remove trailing ``/`` in ``MANIFEST.IN`` recursive includes as this is invalid syntax on windows.
- (`#177 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/177>`_) Fixed SCEN reading bug, can now read SCEN files with "YEAR" in first column rather than "YEARS"
- (`#163 <https://github.com/openscm/pymagicc/pull/163>`_) Confirmed HFC-245fa misnaming in MAGICC6 (i.e. HFC-245fa was mistakenly labelled as HFC-245ca). Accordingly, we:

  - fixed this naming in the SRES scenarios (changing HFC-245ca to HFC-245fa)
  - removed ``pymagicc/MAGICC6/run/HISTRCP_HFC245ca_CONC.IN`` to avoid repeating this confusion
  - ensured that anyone who finds a file with "HFC-245ca" in it in future will get a warning, see ``tests/test_definitions.py``
